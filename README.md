It contains three randomly generated curves.

You can load your own local data file by clicking the **Browse...** button at the top of the page.
The expected data format is **csv** with column names.
The first column must contain the common x-positions of the data samples, while the following columns contain the y-positions of each of the sampled curves.

There is also a demo of the code in this repo running [here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~heimerl/pasta/).
